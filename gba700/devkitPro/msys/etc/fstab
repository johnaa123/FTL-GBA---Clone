# This file describes how to map the Unix-style filenames that
# the devkitPro tools use into Windows filenames, so it's effectively
# saying where devkitPro is installed on your Windows machine.
#
# Things to bear in mind:
#
# - The path must start with a drive letter, and can't have any
#   spaces in it.
#   "C:/gba700" and "F:/DevTools/gba700" are OK.
#   "C:/Program Files/gba700" and "//MyServer/gba700" aren't.
#
# - Use / rather than \ when writing the path.
#
# - There needs to be a tab character (not spaces) between the
#   two paths.

C:/gba700	/dev
